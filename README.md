# Sample Implementation of HTML Form

Please study this example and please be ready for an onsite 4th Graded Exercise on Forms

## Files to focus on:

1. public/index.html - this setups the forms
2. server.js - this setups the webserver and reacts to the submitted form
3. views/pages/acceptFormData.hbs - it is a templated web page document and called through server.js and make the form value part of the page.
